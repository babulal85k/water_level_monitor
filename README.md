Water Level Monitoring System
Project Overview
This project involves creating a water level monitoring system using a NodeMCU board with an ultrasonic sensor. The system collects water level data and sends it to a Flask-based backend server, which stores the data in a SQLite database. A React frontend displays this data in real-time, and the system can send alerts when the water level crosses predefined thresholds.

Components
NodeMCU (ESP8266)
Ultrasonic Sensor
Computer with Arduino IDE, Python, and Node.js installed
Setup
Hardware Setup
NodeMCU and Ultrasonic Sensor Connection:
Connect the VCC, GND, Trig, and Echo pins of the ultrasonic sensor to the corresponding pins on the NodeMCU.
Software Setup
Backend
Install Python and Flask: Make sure Python is installed on your system, and then install Flask using pip.
Run the Backend Server: Navigate to the backend directory and run python app.py to start the Flask server.
Frontend
Install Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed for React app development.
Run the Frontend Application: Navigate to the frontend directory and run npm start to launch the React application.
NodeMCU Programming
Arduino IDE Setup: Install and configure the Arduino IDE for NodeMCU.
Upload Code: Upload the provided script to the NodeMCU to start sending water level data to the backend server.
Usage
The React frontend can be accessed via a web browser to view real-time water level data.
Configure alert thresholds through the frontend interface.
The backend server stores all incoming data in the SQLite database for historical analysis.
